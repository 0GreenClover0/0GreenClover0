### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and versatile developer who thrives at the intersection of **creativity and low-level systems**. Whether it's building award-winning games, crafting custom engines, or contributing to operating systems, I take pride in understanding how things work under the <br/>hood - and pushing them further.

I enjoy building complex systems from scratch, solving hard problems, and contributing to design decisions. I'm deeply interested in how users interact with the software I create - I observe playtests, ask questions, and analyze feedback to improve both functionality and experience.
